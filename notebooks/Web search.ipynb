    "\n",
    "# Implementation Overview:\n",
    "# - Creates an OpenAI assistant instance set up to call Bing-search and analysis functions (funcs defined in this script)\n",
    "# - Uses Bing Search API to conduct internet searches based on the processed user query. NOTE: Can easily be swapped to use the Bing Custom Search service (aka resource) instead (which allows you to define what sites it can search, and what sites it can't search)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bing API & Service (resource) Setup:\n",
    "# 1. Sign Up for Azure\n",
    "#   - If you don't already have one, create a Microsoft Azure account at Azure Portal.\n",
    "# 2. Go to the Azure Marketplace within the Azure Portal\n",
    "# 3. Create a new Bing Search resource \n",
    "#   - If you wish to limit the search window to certain URLs or domains, then see comments listing 'Bing Custom Search' below.\n",
    "# 4. Copy the API key from the Azure Portal\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of the Process:\n",
    "# 1: User Request: \n",
    "#   - The user provides a plain-english request for information (e.g. \"What are the best stonks to buy right now?\").\n",
    "# 2. Automated Bing Web-Search: \n",
    "#   - OpenAI assistant generates a query to search Bing\n",
    "#   - Implements the Bing Web Search API to conduct internet searches based on the processed user query.\n",
    "#   - If the user request isn't clear enough to form a Bing-search query from (example query: \"sup man?\"), then the assistant will (likely) respond seeking more information.\n",
    "# 3. Automated Search Result Processing: \n",
    "#   - Analyzes and processes the search results obtained from Bing, again using the OpenAI assistant instance.\n",
    "#   - The assistant will then provide a summary of the search results, tailored to answer the user's initial query.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Tom's Guide** (https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-dishwashers,review-6292.html)\n",
      "   - The article is likely an updated guide for the best dishwashers of 2024 curated by Katie Mortram.\n",
      "   - The last update was on December 8, 2023.\n",
      "   - The content is focused on various family sizes and budgets but does not specify the criteria for selection or how they tested the dishwashers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consumer Reports** (https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/dishwashers/best-dishwashers-of-the-year-a6109623431/)\n",
      "   - This webpage lists standout dishwasher models from Bosch, Ikea, and other brands.\n",
      "   - The content is authored by Molly Bradley and Liam McCabe, with updates by Daniel Bortz.\n",
      "   - It was updated on January 1, 2024, and it indicates that the dishwashers have been tested, although it does not provide specific testing details.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wirecutter - The New York Times** (https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-dishwasher/)\n",
      "   - This guide states that their previous top pick, the Bosch 300 Series SHEM63W55N, has been discontinued.\n",
      "   - They recommend a replacement model and continue to endorse the earlier model as long as it remains available.\n",
      "   - However, the specific URL provided does not match the usual Wirecutter URL format and could either be an error or an outdated link as the title suggests they will review three top dishwashers without specifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Forbes Vetted** (https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-dishwashers/)\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Reviewed** (https://reviewed.usatoday.com/dishwashers/best-right-now/best-dishwashers)\n",

      "   - The content was updated on January 1, 2024, and authored by Pamela Vachon who is listed as an expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **The Spruce** (https://www.thespruce.com/best-dishwashers-4109539)\n",

      "   - There is also mention of other top models, suggesting that the list is diversified to meet different needs and preferences.\n",

      "In analyzing these results, it is important to note that these articles may provide rankings based on various factors such as cleaning performance, features, reliability, noise level, energy efficiency, and value for money. They seem to agree that Bosch dishwashers are among the top contenders. However, it would be advisable for a user to read the specific articles to understand the testing methodology, review criteria, and to access the most current information since models and rankings can change. Additionally, the credibility of these sources is generally high; organizations like Consumer Reports and Wirecutter are known for their thorough testing and unbiased reporting.\n",

      "8. **The Spruce**\n",

      "   - Summary: This piece focuses on the portability of dishwashers, with a specific mention of a GE portable model. It gives options for those who might have space constraints or require mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "- Most of these websites are reputable sources for product reviews and consumer advice, such as Tom's Guide, Consumer Reports, Wirecutter (part of The New York Times), Forbes, Good Housekeeping, and CNET.\n",
      "- The articles are current as of late 2023 or the beginning of 2024, ensuring that the recommendations are recent and relevant.\n",
      "- Bosch is a brand that's mentioned multiple times across different sources, particularly its 300 and 800 series, indicating that it is likely a top-performing brand.\n",
      "- The emphasis on various features (efficiency, value, testing by experts, modern features) suggests that these articles cater to a wide range of consumer priorities.\n",
      "- The articles appear to be doing thorough testing and updating their content regularly; this is especially important for reviews since models can be discontinued and replaced by manufacturers frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, these search results provide a diverse range of options for someone researching dishwashers available in the U.S. in 2024, from various price points and brands to features prioritizing performance or convenience. However, for a comprehensive decision, one might need to read the full reviews and cross-reference between these sources, especially noticing any models that are consistently highly rated.\n",

      "assistant: The search results provided do not contain a direct comparison table for dishwashers in 2024. Usually, comparison tables are embedded within the articles and are not indexed separately by search engines, making them harder to find directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the search results do include a link to the \"Best Dishwashers of 2024\" by \"This Old House,\" which suggests a section labeled \"Compare Top Dishwashers.\" This may indicate that within the article, there is a comparison table that users can consult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a link to the article for you to check out: [6 Best Dishwashers (2024 Guide) - This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/home-finances/reviews/best-dishwasher)\n",

      "You may find a structured comparison of dishwashers there that includes different models along with their features, performance, and other relevant details.\n",

      "For further assistance, I would advise checking out the article directly or using the search results provided to access the individual articles which may contain comparison tables or lists that can help in making an informed choice.\n",
      "assistant: I apologize for the confusion, but it seems that there has been an error with processing the search results into a comparison table. The search results provide links and summaries to various sources that discuss the best dishwashers in 2024, but to create a comparison table manually, I would need to extract specific product information from each source, which is not possible without direct access to the content of the articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assist you in obtaining a comparison table of specific dishwasher models for 2024, I will need to use a different approach. I will perform another Bing search to attempt to directly find a comparison table that has already been created by one of these reputable sources. Please hold on for a moment.\n",
      "assistant: Unfortunately, the current search results don't directly provide a comparative table or structured comparison between different products. Each source listed in the search results reviews and ranks dishwashers based on their own criteria, which includes testing, features, value for money, and more. To obtain a comparison of products, further analysis and synthesis of these sources' content would be needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a detailed product comparison, one would have to visit each website individually, compare the top dishwashers recommended by each source, and collate the information into a comparative format, taking note of any overlap or consensus between the lists. This would provide insight into which dishwasher models are consistently rated highly across different sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would like, I can attempt to provide a more structured product comparison by visiting each site and compiling the information into a coherent table. However, this would be a manually intensive task requiring more in-depth review of each source's content. Let me know if you wish to proceed with this or have any other specific requests!\n",
