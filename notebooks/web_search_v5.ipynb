    "#   - Implements the Bing Web Search API to conduct internet searches based on the processed user query.\n",
    "#   - If the user request isn't clear enough to form a Bing-search query from (example query: \"sup man?\"), then the assistant will (likely) respond seeking more information.\n",
    "# 3. Automated Search Result Processing: \n",
    "#   - Analyzes and processes the search results obtained from Bing, again using the OpenAI assistant instance.\n",
